# breast-cancer-detection using CNN and Sequential model
Deep learning approach for breast cancer detection using Convolutional Neural Networks and Keras Sequential model - first ML project exploring medical image classification

## Overview
This project implements two different neural network architectures to classify breast tissue patches as malignant or benign. Built as my first machine learning project to explore deep learning applications in medical imaging.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- CNN and Sequential Model architectures
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
- **Source:** Breast Histopathology Images (Kaggle)
- **Sample:** 20,000 patches from 277,524 total images
- **Format:** 50x50 pixel RGB histopathology patches
- **Classes:** Binary (0=Benign, 1=Malignant)

## Model Comparison

| Model | Accuracy | Loss |
|-------|----------|------|
| Sequential Model | 86% | 35% |
| CNN | 85% | 37% |

## Key Features
- Comparative analysis of two neural network approaches
- Image preprocessing and data augmentation
- Binary classification for cancer detection
- Performance visualization and metrics

## Learning Outcomes
- First exposure to medical AI applications
- Understanding of different neural network architectures
- Experience with image classification and model comparison
- Data preprocessing techniques for medical imaging

## Note
This project was developed as a learning exercise, building upon established methodologies in medical machine learning.
